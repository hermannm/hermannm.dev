In the fall of 2015, I started studying at Foss High School in Oslo. During my 3 years there, I took
courses on engineering maths, physics, IT and macroeconomics, in addition to the courses required
for all Norwegian students.

IT became my favorite subject, in large part thanks to my teacher. He taught us the building blocks
of web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, even modern parts like native animations with
HTML5 and CSS3. We were also taught basic SQL and a tiny bit of PHP, giving us a peek into the world
of backend development.
