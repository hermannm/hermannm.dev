I first started considering NTNU (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) in my first
year of high school, when I was thinking about what I wanted to study. At the time, I couldn't
decide between studying tech or economics, thinking I had to make a choice between the two. But then
I discovered Industrial Economics and Technology Management, a master's degree at NTNU which
combines technology, economics and management. That became my goal, which in turn became reality in
the fall of 2018.

At Industrial Economics, I specialized in Computer Science. Although I enjoyed my studies, I found
that I increasingly preferred the programming-focused courses over the ones on economics and
management. This came to a head in my fourth year, when I was to choose the focus area for my
master's thesis. I realized that what I really wanted to do was write a pure Computer Science
degree. And so I decided to switch my degree, from Industrial Economics to Computer Science.

Due to my previous specialization in Industrial Economics, there was a lot of overlap between what
I'd studied there and what I needed for Computer Science. And so the switch only extended my degree
by half a year, meaning I would write my master's in the fall of 2023, rather than the spring.
Looking back, I couldn't be happier with this choice. It allowed me to take Computer Science courses
that I was passionate about, and made me realize that software development is what I want to focus
my career on.

I've learned a lot through my time at NTNU. I think my favorite course has been _Software
Architecture_, which is where I helped build the [Corona Defense](/corona-defense) project. In
addition to this fun project, the course taught me useful concepts and patterns of software
architecture, which I find myself thinking about when making technical choices as a developer.
