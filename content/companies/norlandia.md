In January 2018, during my last semester of high school, I started working part-time at
Ullernhjemmet elderly care. I worked full-time for a few weeks the following summer, and came back
again for the summer of 2019.

The work mostly revolved around helping the elderly with all their needs, and keeping them company.
Although a tough job at times, I think it made me more compassionate and caring.
