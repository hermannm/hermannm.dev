When I moved to Trondheim in the fall of 2018, I started training at the gym Fresh Fitness along
with a friend of mine. The following year, in May 2019, a poster came up at the gym advertising an
open position. I figured it could be nice to have a part-time job next to my studies, so I applied
⁠— and I got the job! For the next year and a half, I worked at Fresh one evening a week, and also
every third weekend. The work consisted of serving our customers, selling memberships and keeping
the gym tidy.

I eventually quit in the fall of 2020, when I joined _Rubberdøk_ (as described in my
[indok-web](/indok-web) project) and found it too much to handle beside my studies.
