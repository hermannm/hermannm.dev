Liflig is a firm that delivers tailor-made software projects for clients, taking responsibility for
the full lifecycle of a project - architecture, design, development, maintenance and operations. The
key that makes this model work well is the Liflig Delivery Platform: a set of tools and libraries,
both on the infrastructure and application side, that allow us to quickly bootstrap and iterate on
new projects and services.

My work at Liflig started with an internship in the summer of 2023. Our team of interns were tasked
with building a backend system and admin UI for [IDTag](https://www.idtagtech.com/), an exciting
startup! Through the project, I got the opportunity to set up integration tests with
[`testcontainers`](https://testcontainers.com/), use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
frontend styling, and even implement login through
[Apple's OAuth API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_rest_api).
I learned a lot from all this, and I'm proud of what our team delivered.

In February 2024, after delivering my [master's thesis](/analysis), I started working full-time for
Liflig. Here I'm working with the same tech stack as in my internship, but at a larger scale, with
microservices and event-driven architecture.
