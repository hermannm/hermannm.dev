In June 2023, I started a summer internship as a software developer at Capra, an IT consulting firm.
I'm working in the 'Liflig' department, which takes more of an in-house approach to their projects,
with greater control of the tech stack and deployment. Our project this summer is to build a backend
system and admin platform for [IDTAG](https://www.idtagtech.com/), an exciting startup! The
internship has just begun as I'm writing this, so I'm excited to see where it leads.
