In June 2023, I started a summer internship as a software developer at Capra, an IT consulting firm.
I worked in the Liflig division, which takes more of an in-house approach to their projects, with
greater control of the tech stack and deployment. Our project this summer was to build a backend
system and admin platform for [IDTAG](https://www.idtagtech.com/), an exciting startup!

Through the project, I got the opportunity to set up integration tests with
[testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/), use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
frontend styling, and even implement login through
[Apple's OAuth API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_rest_api)!
I learned a lot from all this, and I'm proud of what our team delivered.
