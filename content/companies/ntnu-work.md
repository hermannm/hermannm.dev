In the spring semester of 2019, I took the course _Object-Oriented Programming_ at NTNU. As
described in my [Minesweeper](/minesweeper) project, I found my passion for programming in this
course. And so I was delighted to get the opportunity to teach the course to others the next year,
in the spring of 2020, as a teaching assistant.

My work mostly involved helping students with the intricacies of Java and object-oriented design. I
found that I really enjoyed teaching these concepts ⁠— so much that I returned to it again in the
spring of 2021!
