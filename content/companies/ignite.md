Ignite has built a platform where businesses can analyze their data on spend, suppliers, carbon
emissions and so forth. The technology backing it is a sprawling microservice architecture written
in multiple languages, but primarily Go. In 2022, I got the opportunity to work on this platform as
an intern. The scale of the project was much larger than anything I had worked on previously.
Dealing with the complexities of microservices was quite challenging, but also a lot of fun. Towards
the end of my internship, I even got to deploy my own Go microservice!

I worked part-time for Ignite next to my studies in the spring of 2022, then full-time for 9 weeks
in the summer, then part-time again through the fall semester. I learned a lot through this, not
only on the technical side, but also on the human side of working as part of a team and
organization.
