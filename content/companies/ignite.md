My work at Ignite began in January 2022, when I started working part-time one day a week from
Trondheim. In the summer of that year, I went to their Oslo office for 9 weeks to work full-time as
a summer intern. After my internship, I continued working part-time from Trondheim through the fall
semester.

The work involved full-stack development of the Ignite platform, using the technologies listed
above. The scale of the project was much larger than anything I had worked on previously. I got to
work a lot with Ignite's microservice architecture, which was quite challenging, but also a lot of
fun. Towards the end of my internship, I even got to deploy my own Go microservice!
