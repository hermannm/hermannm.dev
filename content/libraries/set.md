A Go package that provides generic Set data structures (collections of unique elements). It
implements a [`HashSet`](https://pkg.go.dev/hermannm.dev/set#HashSet), an
[`ArraySet`](https://pkg.go.dev/hermannm.dev/set#ArraySet) and a
[`DynamicSet`](https://pkg.go.dev/hermannm.dev/set#DynamicSet), with a common interface between
them.
