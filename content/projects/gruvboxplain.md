One of the things I enjoy is setting up my development environment to look just the way I like it.
When looking around for a good color theme for my code editor, I found
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#readme), and quite liked it. But the theme's contrasts
were still a bit too sharp for my taste, so I decided to make my own, plainer variant:
gruvbox-plain. Over the course of my programming projects, I've kept improving the theme's support
for various syntaxes, and even made two different variants.
