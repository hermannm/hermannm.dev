One of the things I enjoy is setting up my development environment to look just the way I like it.
When looking around for a good color theme for my editor, I found
[`gruvbox`](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#readme), and quite liked it — but the theme's
contrasts were a bit too sharp for my taste. So I decided to make my own, plainer variant:
_`gruvbox-plain`_!

Over the course of my projects, I've kept improving the theme's support for various programming
languages, and made two different variants. I've also published the theme as a
[plugin for the IntelliJ IDE](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27768-gruvbox-plain) and an
[extension for the VSCode editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hermannm.gruvbox-plain).
