One of the things I enjoy is setting up my development environment to look just the way I like it.
When looking around for a good color theme for my code editor, I found
[`gruvbox`](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#readme), and quite liked it. But the theme's
contrasts were still a bit too sharp for my taste, so I decided to make my own, plainer variant:
_`gruvbox-plain`_. Over the course of my programming projects, I've kept improving the theme's
support for various syntaxes, and even made two different variants!
