Before December 2022, I had never tried [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about), nor
programmed in Rust. That changed this advent, as I decided to use Advent of Code to learn Rust! Each
morning, a new coding task was published, and as the calendar went on, the tasks became harder and
harder. This format worked well to learn a new language, as the relatively easy early days allowed
me to familiarize myself with Rust's syntax, and then the growing difficulty made me delve deeper
and deeper into the language. The latter days were some of the most mentally challenging programming
I had done at that point, but through blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to complete it by the
25th!
