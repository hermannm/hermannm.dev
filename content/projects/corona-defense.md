In the spring semester of 2021, I took the course _Software Architecture_ at NTNU. The main part of
that course was a group project to build a mobile game, with particular emphasis on the game's
architecture. My group came up with _Corona Defense_, an online multiplayer variation of the classic
tower defense genre. The players fight swaths of incoming corona viruses, using "weapons" such as
doctors, nurses and vaccines.

I mainly worked on the mobile client, developing the user interface and display of data coming from
the server. Since we made the game for Android, I got the pleasure of working with Kotlin, which was
a breath of fresh air compared to what I'd previously done with Java.
