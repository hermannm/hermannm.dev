In the spring semester of 2022, I took the course _Experts in Teamwork_ at NTNU. The course involved
a group project to build something related to video games in the maritime sector. My group decided
to build a simulator of ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles; underwater drones), and named it
_ROV-SIM_. We built it with the Unity game engine, and in the end, we produced a working prototype
with 2 simulated ROV scenarios! I mostly worked with the game scripts for the ROV's movement
controls and the main menu.

In the research phase of the project, we contacted several different companies producing ROVs, to
gain a better understanding of how to build a realistic simulator. We were quite overwhelmed by the
responses â€” all our questions were answered by every company, and many of them provided additional
resources for further research. _Blueye Robotics_, a drone company headquartered in Trondheim, went
even further: they invited us to their office, to test a real ROV! This was a great experience, and
helped us a lot to improve the realism of the simulator.
