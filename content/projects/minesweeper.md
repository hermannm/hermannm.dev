In the spring semester of 2019, I took a course on object-oriented programming at NTNU. One part of
the course was a project to develop an application with Java. I chose to build a copy of
Minesweeper, the classic Windows game. At this point, I had little previous experience with
programming, but this project helped ignite my passion for software. Even after delivering the
project, I stayed up one night to polish the user interface (and kept going until 5 AM, to get the
UI just right...).

This project still has a special place in my heart. In the spring of 2022, I went back to the
project to configure [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), allowing me to build a distributable JAR file
for the game.
