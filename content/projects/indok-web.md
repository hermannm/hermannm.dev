In the fall of 2020, _Rubberdøk_ was founded, a student organization tasked with developing
[indokntnu.no](https://indokntnu.no/), a new website for the study program I was studying at the
time. For the following two years, I worked 8 hours/week alongside 10 other student developers,
using the technologies listed above. It's hard to overstate how much I learned from this project —
it gave me a solid understanding of modern web development.

One year after our founding, I became project manager of _Rubberdøk_ alongside Lars, another member.
In this role, I coordinated our continued work on the website, and also dealt with feature requests
from various stakeholders. In the fall of 2022, I held courses in React, Django, Next.js and Git to
our new members. We then elected a new project manager, and I stepped down from the project,
realizing that I needed more time for school, work and other projects. Leaving the project was
tough, but I felt like I left it in good hands after teaching the foundations of web development to
our new members.
