          Hello there! I'm Hermann Mørkrid, a Computer Science student at NTNU Trondheim. I mostly do web development
          (frontend and backend) and some hobby game development. Below you can read about some of my projects, as well
          as places I've worked and studied.

              In the fall of 2020, <em>Rubberdøk</em> was founded, a student organization tasked with developing
              <a href="https://indokntnu.no/" target="_blank">indokntnu.no</a>, a new website for the study program I
              was studying at the time. For the following two years, I worked 8 hours/week alongside 10 other student
              developers, using the technologies listed above. It's hard to overstate how much I learned from this
              project — it gave me a solid understanding of modern web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              One year after our founding, I became project manager of
              <em>Rubberdøk</em> alongside Lars, another member. In this role, I coordinated our continued work on the
              website, and also dealt with feature requests from various stakeholders.

              The story of this project starts in the fall of 2020, when my dad gave me one of the coolest birthday
              gifts I've ever received: he created a board game for me! The rather awkwardly named
              <em>Battle for Hermannia</em> is a game of strategy, diplomacy and intrigue. I've played it a lot with
              friends in Trondheim, and this inspired us to develop a digital edition of the game, starting in November
              2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote the server in Go, finding its native concurrency support suitable for the parallel nature of the
              game. The client I developed together with
              <a href="https://immersentnu.no/" target="_blank">Immerse NTNU</a>, a student organization for game
              development founded by a friend of mine. We used the Unity game engine, which in turn uses C# for
              scripting game logic.

              In the spring semester of 2022, I took the course <em>Design of Communicating Systems</em> at NTNU. A part
              of that course was a group project to build a video chat application. And thus CoffeeTalk was born: a web
              app with peer-to-peer video streaming, and even a basic quiz game! We developed the application as 3
              servers (one for serving the web app, one for WebRTC video stream coordination, and one for the quiz game
              using MQTT). The servers were all written in Go, while the web app was written in vanilla JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, we deployed the app with
              <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. My proudest moment that semester
              was having an hour-long conversation with my dad through my own video chat app!

              In the spring semester of 2021, I took the course <em>Software Architecture</em> at NTNU. The main part of
              that course was a group project to build a mobile game, with particular emphasis on the game's
              architecture. My group came up with <em>Corona Defense</em>, an online multiplayer variation of the
              classic tower defense genre. The players fight swaths of incoming corona viruses, using "weapons" such as
              doctors, nurses and vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
              I mainly worked on the mobile client, developing the user interface and display of data coming from the
              server. Since we made the game for Android, I got the pleasure of working with Kotlin, which was a breath
              of fresh air compared to what I'd previously done with Java.

              In the spring semester of 2019, I took a course on object-oriented programming at NTNU. One part of the
              course was a project to develop an application with Java. I chose to build a copy of Minesweeper, the
              classic Windows game. At this point, I had little previous experience with programming, but this project
              helped ignite my passion for software. Even after delivering the project, I stayed up one night to polish
              the user interface (and kept going until 5 in the morning, to get the UI just right...).
            </p>
            <p>
              This project still has a special place in my heart. In the spring of 2022, I went back to the project to
              configure <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a>, allowing me to build a distributable
              JAR file for the game.

              One of the things I enjoy is setting up my development environment to look just the way I like it. When
              looking around for a good color theme for my code editor, I found
              <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#readme" target="_blank">gruvbox</a>, and quite liked it. But
              the theme's contrasts were still a bit too sharp for my taste, so I decided to make my own, plainer
              variant: gruvbox-plain. Over the course of my programming projects, I've kept improving the theme's
              support for various syntaxes, and even made two different variants.

              My work at Ignite began in January 2022, when I started working part-time one day a week from Trondheim.
              In the summer of that year, I went to their Oslo office for 9 weeks to work full-time as a summer intern.
              After my internship, I continued working part-time from Trondheim the following semester.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work involved full-stack development of the Ignite Procurement platform, using the technologies listed
              above. In many ways, it resembled what I had previously done in the indok-web project (described above),
              but at a much larger scale. I also got to work with Ignite's microservice architecture, which taught me a
              lot. Towards the end of my internship, I even got to deploy my own Go microservice!

              In the spring semester of 2019, I took the course Object-Oriented Programming at NTNU. As described above
              in the section on my Minesweeper project, I found my passion for programming in this course. And so I was
              delighted to get the opportunity to teach the course to others the next year, in the spring of 2020, as a
              teaching assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work mostly involved helping students with the intricacies of Java and object-oriented design. I found
              that I really enjoyed teaching these concepts ⁠— so much that I returned to it again in the spring of
              2021!

              When I moved to Trondheim in the fall of 2018, I started training at the gym Fresh Fitness along with a
              friend of mine. The following year, in May 2019, a poster came up at the gym advertising an open position.
              I figured it could be nice to have a part-time job next to my studies, so I applied ⁠— and I got the job!
              For the next year and a half, I worked at Fresh one evening a week, and also every third weekend. The work
              consisted of serving our customers, selling memberships and keeping the gym tidy.

              I eventually quit in the fall of 2020, when I joined <em>Rubberdøk</em> (as described above in the section
              on the indok-web project) and found it too much to handle beside my studies.

              elderly care. I worked full-time for a few weeks the following summer, and came back again for the summer
              of 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work mostly revolved around helping the elderly with all their needs, and keeping them company.
              Although a tough job at times, I think it made me more compassionate and caring.

              I first started considering NTNU in my first year of high school, when I was thinking about what I wanted
              to study. At the time, I couldn't decide between studying tech or economics, thinking I had to make a
              choice between the two. But then I discovered Industrial Economics and Technology Management, a master's
              degree at NTNU which combines technology, economics and management. That became my goal, which in turn
              became reality in the fall of 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Industrial Economics, I specialized in Computer Science. Although I enjoyed my studies, I found that I
              increasingly preferred the programming-focused courses over the ones on economics and management. This
              came to a head in my fourth year, when I was to choose the focus area for my master's thesis. I realized
              that what I <em>really</em> wanted to do was write a pure Computer Science degree. And so I decided to
              switch my degree, from Industrial Economics to Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to my previous specialization in Industrial Economics, there was a lot of overlap between what I'd
              studied there and what I needed for Computer Science. And so the switch only extended my degree by half a
              year, meaning I would write my master's in the fall of 2023, rather than the spring. Looking back, I
              couldn't be happier with this choice. It allowed me to take Computer Science courses that I was passionate
              about, and made me realize that software development is what I want to focus my career on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've learned a lot through my time at NTNU. I think my favorite course has been
              <em>Software Architecture</em>, which is where I helped build the <em>Corona Defense</em> project
              described in sections above. In addition to this fun project, the course taught me useful concepts and
              patterns of software architecture, which I find myself thinking about when making technical choices as a
              developer.

              In the fall of 2015, I started studying at Foss High School in Oslo. During my 3 years there, I took
              courses on engineering maths, physics, IT and macroeconomics, in addition to the courses required for all
              Norwegian students.
            </p>
            <p>
              IT became my favorite subject, in large part thanks to my teacher. He taught us the building blocks of web
              development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, even modern parts like native animations with HTML5 and CSS3.
              We were also taught basic SQL and a tiny bit of PHP, giving us a peek into the world of backend
              development.
