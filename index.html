            In the fall of 2020, <em>Rubberdøk</em> was founded, a student organization tasked with
            developing <a href="https://indokntnu.no/" target="_blank">indokntnu.no</a>, a new
            website for the study program I was studying at the time. For the following two years, I
            worked 8 hours/week alongside 10 other student developers, using the technologies listed
            above. It's hard to overstate how much I learned from this project — it gave me a solid
            understanding of modern web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            One year after our founding, I became project manager of <em>Rubberdøk</em> alongside
            Lars, another member. In this role, I coordinated our continued work on the website, and
            also dealt with feature requests from various stakeholders. In the fall of 2022, I held
            courses in React, Django, Next.js and Git to our new members. We then elected a new
            project manager, and I stepped down from the project, realizing that I needed more time
            for school, work and other projects. Leaving the project was tough, but I felt like I
            left it in good hands after teaching the foundations of web development to our new
            members.

            coolest birthday gifts I've ever received. He made me my very own board game:
            <em>The Battle for Hermannia</em>! The game involves strategy, diplomacy and intrigue,
            and I've played it a lot with friends in Trondheim. A couple friends of mine were
            particular fans of the game, and so in November 2021, we started developing a digital
            edition of it as a hobby project.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided to build the digital edition as a proper multiplayer online game. I wrote the
            server in Go, finding its native concurrency support suitable for the parallel nature of
            the game. My friends and I collaborated on the client, where we used C# with the Unity
            game engine. During this time, one of my friends also founded
            <a href="https://immersentnu.no/" target="_blank">Immerse NTNU</a>, a student
            organization for game development. He made this game client their first project, and so
            we also got invaluable help from new members there.

            In the spring semester of 2022, I took the course
            <em>Design of Communicating Systems</em> at NTNU. A part of that course was a group
            project to build a video chat application. And thus CoffeeTalk was born: a web app with
            peer-to-peer video streaming, and even a basic quiz game! We developed the application
            as 3 servers (one for serving the web app, one for WebRTC video stream coordination, and
            one for the quiz game using MQTT). The servers were all written in Go, while the web app
            was written in vanilla JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, we deployed the app with
            <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. My proudest
            moment that semester was having an hour-long conversation with my dad through my own
            video chat app!

            In the spring semester of 2021, I took the course <em>Software Architecture</em> at
            NTNU. The main part of that course was a group project to build a mobile game, with
            particular emphasis on the game's architecture. My group came up with
            <em>Corona Defense</em>, an online multiplayer variation of the classic tower defense
            genre. The players fight swaths of incoming corona viruses, using "weapons" such as
            doctors, nurses and vaccines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mainly worked on the mobile client, developing the user interface and display of data
            coming from the server. Since we made the game for Android, I got the pleasure of
            working with Kotlin, which was a breath of fresh air compared to what I'd previously
            done with Java.

            In the spring semester of 2022, I took the course <em>Experts in Teamwork</em> at NTNU.
            The course involved a group project to build something related to video games in the
            maritime sector. My group decided to build a simulator of ROVs (Remotely Operated
            Vehicles; underwater drones), and named it <em>ROV-SIM</em>. We built it with the Unity
            game engine, and in the end, we produced a working prototype with 2 simulated ROV
            scenarios! I mostly worked with the game scripts for the ROV's movement controls and the
            main menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the research phase of the project, we contacted several different companies producing
            ROVs, to gain a better understanding of how to build a realistic simulator. We were
            quite overwhelmed by the responses &mdash; all our questions were answered by every
            company, and many of them provided additional resources for further research.
            <em>Blueye Robotics</em>, a drone company headquartered in Trondheim, went even further:
            they invited us to their office, to test a real ROV! This was a great experience, and
            helped us a lot to improve the realism of the simulator.

            In the fall semester of 2022, I took the course <em>Customer-Driven Project</em> at
            NTNU. In the course, five other Computer Science students and I were given a project
            from a real customer: <em>Safetec</em>, a consulting firm specializing in risk
            management. Our project was to build a tool for searching through the regulations of the
            Norwegian Export Control Law, which restricts the export of certain sensitive products
            and technologies. Just a year before our project, the regulations were expanded, and now
            included a 250 page list with a wide variety of regulated items. Several of Safetec's
            customers were worried about how the regulations might affect them, and had trouble
            navigating the new lists. The goal of our tool was to be a resource that Safetec could
            give to their customers, so they can find out if export control affects them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our final product was a web application built with Django, using PostgreSQL for its
            database. We deployed the application in Safetec's Azure cloud, where it is now running
            at
            <a href="https://exportcontrol.safetec.no/" target="_blank">exportcontrol.safetec.no</a
            >. I was quite proud of our final result, as we were able to deliver a fully functional
            product that the customer was happy with. The project taught me a lot about the
            back-and-forth process of requirement elicitation, and dealing with changing
            requirements.

            Before December 2022, I had never done Advent of Code, nor programmed in Rust. That
            changed this advent, as I decided to use Advent of Code to learn Rust! Each morning, a
            new coding task was published, and as the calendar went on, the tasks became harder and
            harder. This format worked well to learn a new language, as the relatively easy early
            days allowed me to familiarize myself with Rust's syntax, and then the growing
            difficulty made me delve deeper and deeper into the language. The latter days were some
            of the most mentally challenging programming I had done at that point, but through
            blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to complete it by the 25th!

            In the spring semester of 2019, I took a course on object-oriented programming at NTNU.
            One part of the course was a project to develop an application with Java. I chose to
            build a copy of Minesweeper, the classic Windows game. At this point, I had little
            previous experience with programming, but this project helped ignite my passion for
            software. Even after delivering the project, I stayed up one night to polish the user
            interface (and kept going until 5 in the morning, to get the UI just right...).
          </p>
          <p>
            This project still has a special place in my heart. In the spring of 2022, I went back
            to the project to configure <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a>,
            allowing me to build a distributable JAR file for the game.

            One of the things I enjoy is setting up my development environment to look just the way
            I like it. When looking around for a good color theme for my code editor, I found
            <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#readme" target="_blank">gruvbox</a>, and
            quite liked it. But the theme's contrasts were still a bit too sharp for my taste, so I
            decided to make my own, plainer variant: gruvbox-plain. Over the course of my
            programming projects, I've kept improving the theme's support for various syntaxes, and
            even made two different variants.

            My work at Ignite began in January 2022, when I started working part-time one day a week
            from Trondheim. In the summer of that year, I went to their Oslo office for 9 weeks to
            work full-time as a summer intern. After my internship, I continued working part-time
            from Trondheim the following semester.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work involved full-stack development of the Ignite Procurement platform, using the
            technologies listed above. In many ways, it resembled what I had previously done in the
            indok-web project (described above), but at a much larger scale. I also got to work with
            Ignite's microservice architecture, which taught me a lot. Towards the end of my
            internship, I even got to deploy my own Go microservice!

            In the spring semester of 2019, I took the course Object-Oriented Programming at NTNU.
            As described above in the section on my Minesweeper project, I found my passion for
            programming in this course. And so I was delighted to get the opportunity to teach the
            course to others the next year, in the spring of 2020, as a teaching assistant.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work mostly involved helping students with the intricacies of Java and
            object-oriented design. I found that I really enjoyed teaching these concepts ⁠— so much
            that I returned to it again in the spring of 2021!

            When I moved to Trondheim in the fall of 2018, I started training at the gym Fresh
            Fitness along with a friend of mine. The following year, in May 2019, a poster came up
            at the gym advertising an open position. I figured it could be nice to have a part-time
            job next to my studies, so I applied ⁠— and I got the job! For the next year and a half,
            I worked at Fresh one evening a week, and also every third weekend. The work consisted
            of serving our customers, selling memberships and keeping the gym tidy.

            I eventually quit in the fall of 2020, when I joined <em>Rubberdøk</em> (as described

            I first started considering NTNU (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) in
            my first year of high school, when I was thinking about what I wanted to study. At the
            time, I couldn't decide between studying tech or economics, thinking I had to make a
            choice between the two. But then I discovered Industrial Economics and Technology
            Management, a master's degree at NTNU which combines technology, economics and
            management. That became my goal, which in turn became reality in the fall of 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Industrial Economics, I specialized in Computer Science. Although I enjoyed my
            studies, I found that I increasingly preferred the programming-focused courses over the
            ones on economics and management. This came to a head in my fourth year, when I was to
            choose the focus area for my master's thesis. I realized that what I
            <em>really</em> wanted to do was write a pure Computer Science degree. And so I decided
            to switch my degree, from Industrial Economics to Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to my previous specialization in Industrial Economics, there was a lot of overlap
            between what I'd studied there and what I needed for Computer Science. And so the switch
            only extended my degree by half a year, meaning I would write my master's in the fall of
            2023, rather than the spring. Looking back, I couldn't be happier with this choice. It
            allowed me to take Computer Science courses that I was passionate about, and made me
            realize that software development is what I want to focus my career on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've learned a lot through my time at NTNU. I think my favorite course has been
            <em>Software Architecture</em>, which is where I helped build the
            <em>Corona Defense</em> project described in sections above. In addition to this fun
            project, the course taught me useful concepts and patterns of software architecture,
            which I find myself thinking about when making technical choices as a developer.
